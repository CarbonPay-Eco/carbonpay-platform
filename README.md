# CarbonPay Platform

CarbonPay is a platform that merges Web3 infrastructure with real-world environmental assets, creating a new way to tokenize, trade, and retire carbon credits. Built on the Solana blockchain, CarbonPay ensures full transparency, traceability, and global liquidity ‚Äî with auditable smart contracts and documentation anchored via IPFS.

![CarbonPay Mockup](assets/plataform.png "CarbonPay Platform Mockup")

## üåç Project Overview

CarbonPay is the bridge between the digital economy and the voluntary carbon market. Our platform enables companies to:

- Register their organization through Solana wallet authentication
- Explore tokenized environmental projects with full metadata and certification
- Purchase and retire carbon credits directly on-chain
- Generate compliance-ready audit reports automatically
- Provide public traceability for each offset using explorer-linked data
- Monitor the entire lifecycle of carbon credit projects, from creation to retirement

## üîê Security & Compliance

CarbonPay is built with a strong focus on security, transparency, and alignment with voluntary market standards.

- Internal audits of all smart contracts before deployment
- On-chain transparency via Solana Explorer: all credit purchases, retirements, and transfers are public
- No sensitive user data is collected thanks to wallet-based access
- Metadata and certification documents are stored on IPFS for immutability
- Designed to meet global certification requirements (Verra, Gold Standard)

## üíº Business Model and Value Proposition

### For Project Owners

- Tokenization of certified carbon credits into traceable SPL tokens
- Access to global liquidity with immediate payments in SOL or USDC
- Project management dashboard with real-time sales data and performance metrics
- No banks or middlemen involved ‚Äî funds go straight to the project‚Äôs wallet
- 95% payout per transaction ‚Äî only 5% platform fee with full transparency

### For Buyers

- Direct access to verified carbon projects with certification and coordinates
- One-click on-chain purchases with real-time settlement
- Retirement of credits creates unique NFTs as proof of offset
- Auto-generated compliance reports with direct links to on-chain proof
- Track credit portfolio with purchases, offsets, categories, and dates

### For Organizations

- Integrate offsetting into ESG strategies with recurring purchase options
- Public profile page showcasing your climate impact and offsets
- Simplified ESG compliance with downloadable reports
- User-friendly interface for sustainability and finance teams
- Proof-of-impact NFTs for internal reports or public campaigns

## üí∏ Revenue Streams
